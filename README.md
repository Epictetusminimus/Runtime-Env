# Runtime-Env (Under construction - To be released in Fall 2021)
This is a [core Flight Systsem (cFS)](https://github.com/nasa/cFE) distribution that serves as the basis for other OpenSatKit distributions and as a starting point for anyone interested in **learning the cFS, starting their own cFS-based project, and developing, integrating, and testing new cFS applications**.

This distribution uses [CCSDS Electronic Datasheets (EDS)](https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/876x0b1.pdf) for application interface definitions. These definitions are propagated via a toolcahin to produce artifacts that are used during the system build, integration, and deployment processes.
