<DesignParameters>
<Package name="CFE_MISSION" shortDescription="EDS definitions specific to the Sample Mission">

  <!--  Constants used throught all commands and telemetry -->
  <Define name="SPACECRAFT_ID" value="42" shortDescription="Spacecraft ID">
    <LongDescription>
      \par Description:
          This defines the value that is returned by the call to
          CFE_PSP_GetSpacecraftId.
     
      \par Limits
           The cFE does not place a limit on this configuration paramter.
           CCSDS allocates 8 bits for this field in the standard VCDU.
    </LongDescription>
  </Define>
  
  <Define name="DATA_BYTE_ORDER" value="bigEndian">
    <LongDescription>
       The byte order for all commands and telemetry in the system.
       
       All packets will always be encoded into this order, and decoded from this
       byte order.  Using a value which matches the native architecture of the CPU
       may help performance by reducing the need to rewrite values, but is not
       required.   
    </LongDescription>
  </Define>
  
  <Define name="SIGNED_INTEGER_ENCODING" value="twosComplement">
    <LongDescription>
       The type of encoding to use for signed integers
    </LongDescription>
  </Define>
  
  <Define name="MAX_CPU_ADDRESS_SIZE" value="8">
    <LongDescription>
       The size for elements containing CPU addresses.  If any 64 bit CPUs are
       in use, then this value should be 8.  If only 32 bit CPUs are in use, this
       may be reduced to 4 to reduce message sizes.
    </LongDescription>
  </Define>
  
  <Define name="TELEMETRY_SUBSECONDS_TYPE" value="BASE_TYPES/uint16">

           This affects the layout of command/telemetry messages but does not affect run
           time behavior or internal allocation.
     
       \par Limits
            All CPUs within the same SB domain (mission) must share the same definition
            Note this affects the size of messages, so it must not cause any message
            to exceed the max length.
            
    </LongDescription>

       \par Description:
            Defines the size of the shell command tlm packet segments.The shell command
            output size is dependant on the shell command itself. If the shell output
            size is greater than the size of the packet defined here, the fsw will
            generate a series of tlm packets (of the size defined here) that can be
            reconstructed by the ground system.
     
           This affects the layout of command/telemetry messages but does not affect run

       \par Description:
            The value of this constant dictates the max number of mempool blocks within SB messages.
            This represents the definition for Software Bus Messages only and is _NOT_ necessarily
            correlated to the corresponding CFE configuration paramter, which can vary from CPU to CPU.
     
       \par Limits

            in use among all CPUs included within the mission.

       \par Description:
            The value of this constant dictates the size of filenames within SB messages.
            This is typically the same as OS_MAX_PATH_LEN but that is OSAL dependent --
            and as such it definable on a per-processor/OS basis and hence may be different
            across multiple processors.  Since this defines a message format, it must be
            consistent across ALL processors exchanging SB messages.
     
            This affects the layout of command/telemetry messages but does not affect run
            time behavior or internal allocation.

            This is typically the same as OS_MAX_API_LEN but that is OSAL dependent --
            and as such it definable on a per-processor/OS basis and hence may be different
            across multiple processors.
